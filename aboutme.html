    <h1 style="padding-top: 5%;">About Me</h1>
    <p>As a rising sophomore in college, the best advice I received was from a professor in my business class. 
        We were meeting to talk about my career goals when he said, 
        "You know, your four-year plan is going to change, right?" I was adamant about the fact that it wouldn't. 
        After spending years in high school committed to majoring in politics and falling in love with making change, 
        I was confident that I would continue to pursue my track to become a lawyer.</p>
    <p>
        However, I didn't realize the truth to his words until I walked out of my first programming class 
        and realized how exhilarating coding was. Initially taking the course with the intent of minoring in 
        data science to supplement my degree in politics, I immediately became enamored by the challenge that 
        programming presented.
        </p>
    <p>
        And now, I'm here: pursing a degree in computer and data science. 
        In the few months that I've changed my major, I've been able to expand my knowledge and understanding 
        into the following areas: Python, JavaScript, React/React Native, and SQL. However, I am always learning 
        and looking to expand my reach. Some might say I've lost sight of my original goal to make change. But if 
        anything, I think I'm just getting started. The world of technology offers so many opportunities to make a 
        difference, and I can't wait to be part of something big! </p>
